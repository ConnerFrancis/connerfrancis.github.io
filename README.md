# [conr.xyz](https://www.conr.xyz)
My personal website built on [vue.js](#technologies) and [github pages](#technologies).

___

### The goal and reasons
The goal of this website is to create one that would host all of my projects, blog/posts/ramblings, and designs on one URL.
I also wanted all this done for free, so I make use of Github Pages free hosting and VueJS because it is a completely client-side website framework.
